Bayesian Inference to Determine the Effect of Homefield Advantage in MLS

This is an analysis of homefield advantage in Major League Soccer using Bayesian inference techniques learned in Prof. Ryan Wesslen's Spring 2022 Statistics Masters Course at UNC-Charlotte. 

This post owes a substantial debt of gratitude to Tyler Burch, currently an analyst for the Boston Red Sox. His original work using Bayesian techniques to identify homefield advantage in Major League Baseball (http://tylerjamesburch.com/blog/baseball/homefield-2020) serves as the inspiration for this analysis. 

To follow along with Tyler (and to see where I got the idea for a number of coding techniques) check out his code available here (https://github.com/tjburch/mlb-homefield-modeling). 

Where insightful, I will specifically call out parallels to Tyler's work. 

Please reach out with any questions you may have!
